# SDK v3 RPC parity audit

**Status:** internal, closed-inventory audit. This is a comparison of the retired
RPC contract at `6e147d58~1:docs/rpc.md` with SDK v3; it is not an event-plane
parity claim. The CLI rejects the retired `--mode rpc`, `rpc-ui`, and `bridge`
modes and directs external control to the SDK (`packages/coding-agent/src/cli/args.ts:117-127`).

The historical issue files (01–08, 11–21) are archived under `issues/archive/` as provenance only. Their current disposition is recorded in `issues/README.md`: implementation findings are resolved, retired RPC documentation findings are obsolete, and persistent-session/registry items (09/10) remain deferred architectural follow-ups. Do not treat this closed audit as an active implementation backlog.

## Method and classifications

The inventory below is **closed**. Command, frame, and sub-protocol rows were
recovered from `git show 6e147d58~1:docs/rpc.md`; the supplemental
`rpc-sessions` registry and `--listen` Unix-socket rows were recovered from
parent-commit source because they do not appear in that document:
`6e147d58~1:packages/coding-agent/src/cli/args.ts:157-158`,
`6e147d58~1:packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-mode.ts:892-907,984-992`,
and
`6e147d58~1:packages/coding-agent/src/modes/shared/agent-wire/session-registry.ts:1-53`.
`SDK equivalent` means a current operation or documented SDK protocol covers the
control/query intent, not that its transport or event semantics are identical.
`transport-gap — retired` means the direct `gjc sdk serve` relay and standalone transport clients were removed when `SessionRouter` became the sole external attachment authority.
`phase-2-gap` means no equivalent has been implemented by this audit.

Operation names and their stated roles are from
`packages/coding-agent/src/sdk/protocol/operation-registry.ts:66-166`; dispatch
coverage is from `packages/coding-agent/src/sdk/host/control/dispatch.ts:138-253`.
SDK protocol and lifecycle references use stable heading references in
`docs/sdk.md`. Command, frame, and sub-protocol rows cite
`6e147d58~1:docs/rpc.md`; the two supplemental rows cite the parent-commit
sources above.

## Five-gap reduction verdict

SDK v3 has broad control/query coverage: the operation registry includes turn,
model, thinking, queue, compaction, retry, bash, session, host callback, and
workflow operations (`operation-registry.ts:66-166`), and control dispatch
implements the control path (`dispatch.ts:138-253`). That does **not** erase the
user-perceived reduction. It is **REAL** across five dimensions:

1. **stdio JSONL and Unix-socket transports.** The interim `gjc sdk serve` relay was retired; external attachment now requires Router-owned opaque capabilities and never forwards endpoint credentials.
2. **Typed Python client.** The interim public Python transport client was retired with the direct relay; cross-process integrations require Router-owned capabilities.
3. **`negotiate_unattended`.** No fail-closed unattended negotiation with the
   retired declaration, budget, scope, and allowlist exists: this remains Phase 2.
4. **Cross-process session registry/reattach.** Discovery files locate a live
   endpoint but do not provide the retired registry or reattach lifecycle: this
   remains Phase 2.
5. **Renderer-grade full event stream.** SDK v3's minimal frames and optional
   threaded-client frames are not the retired canonical session event stream.
   **No event-plane parity is claimed.**

## Ranked Phase-2 follow-up register — NOT implemented

1. **Unattended negotiation equivalent — NOT implemented.** Add a fail-closed
   equivalent to `negotiate_unattended` only with explicit actor, budget, scopes,
   allowlist, and audit enforcement. Partial equivalent only: Q12
   `workflow.gates.list` plus the Coordinator MCP pull loop can enumerate and
   answer durable workflow gates; they are not unattended negotiation
   (`docs/sdk.md §Coordinator MCP question pull loop`).
2. **Reattachment semantics — implemented in SDK core.** `SessionRouter` exclusively resolves private endpoint publication, retains credentials, reconnects, replays, rotates transports, and issues exact opaque attachment capabilities. External adapters do not consume discovery files or raw endpoint credentials.
3. **Full event stream — NOT implemented.** Define a renderer-grade session
   event contract only if consumers require it. Partial equivalent only:
   `action_needed`, `action_resolved`, `reply_rejected`, and optional threaded
   frames such as `turn_stream` exist, but there is **no `onSessionEvent`-style
   SDK equivalent** (`docs/sdk.md §Server → client`).
